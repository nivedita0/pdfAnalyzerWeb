                Question: what does table 2 have

                Answer:
                

--------------------------------------------------

GENERATED ANSWER:
Based on the provided context, Table II is titled "Security controls for automatic logoff (ALOF)". This table presents a list of standards, references, and corresponding security controls related to automatic logoff.

The table includes three international standards:

1. SP 800-53: A set of guidelines from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that provides recommendations for securing federal information systems.
2. ISO/IEC 15408-2: A standard from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) that provides requirements for evaluating the security of IT products.
3. ISO/IEC 27002: A standard from ISO and IEC that provides guidelines for information security management.

The table lists specific controls related to automatic logoff, including:

* Access Control Policy and Management (AC-1)
* Session Lock (AC-11)
* Session Termination (AC-12)
* Re-authentication (IA-11)
* Session Locking and Termination (FTA_SSL)
* Security Attribute Expiration (FMT_SAE)
* User Authentication (FIA_UAU)

These security controls are intended to ensure the secure logoff of users from medical devices, which is critical for maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.
