                Question: what are the controls under ISO 27799

                Answer:
                

--------------------------------------------------

GENERATED ANSWER:
Based on the provided context, it appears that ISO 27799 is one of the medical security standards selected for implementation in IT networks between device manufacturers, IT vendors, and healthcare delivery organisations. However, the specific controls or requirements outlined in ISO 27799 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

The context only mentions that ISO 27799 was selected as one of the medical security standards, along with ISO/IEC 27002 and IEC 62443-3, to establish a set of existing security controls. It does not provide further details on the specific controls or requirements outlined in ISO 27799.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine what the controls under ISO 27799 are based solely on the provided context. To answer this question accurately, one would need access to the actual standard itself or additional information that outlines the specific controls and requirements outlined in ISO 27799.

In summary, while ISO 27799 is mentioned as a selected medical security standard, the specific controls or requirements outlined in the standard are not provided in the given context.
